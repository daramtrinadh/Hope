✅ Question 1: Library Book Inventory
A library keeps a list of book titles available for borrowing. Every day, new books are added, some are removed when borrowed, and duplicates need to be handled.

Your task:

Start with a predefined list of book titles.

For each book in a separate “borrowed” list, remove it from the main list if it exists.

Add new books from an "incoming shipment" list using a loop.

Count how many times a specific book appears.

Reverse the final list and display the inventory.

You should print:

Final list of books

Number of times a specific book appeared

✅ Question 2: Class Topper Finder
You are given a list of student names along with their scores in two separate lists:

python
Copy
Edit
names = ["Amit", "Sita", "Ravi", "Zara"]
scores = [85, 92, 88, 91]
Your task:

Use a loop to find the name of the highest scorer.

Remove the student with the lowest score from both lists.

Insert a new student and their score at the beginning of the list.

Extend the list with a new batch of students and scores.

Reverse the name list for seat allotment.

You should print:

Name of the topper

Final student list

Final score list

✅ Question 3: Order Processing System
You're managing an order queue in an online shop. Orders come in as a list of order IDs. Some get canceled, some are delivered (popped), and new ones keep coming.

Your task:

Process orders in a while loop: pop and mark as “delivered” until the queue is empty or a specific stop ID is found.

Append new orders from another list.

Remove any duplicate order IDs from the queue.

Display the number of orders processed.

You should print:

List of delivered orders

Final list of pending orders

✅ Question 4: Voting System Validator
You are validating votes in a list of voter IDs. Some voter IDs are invalid (appear more than once), and some are missing from the expected range.

Your task:

Given a list of voter IDs (integers), use a loop to count how many duplicates exist.

Remove duplicates using list methods.

Check using a loop which voter IDs from range(1, 11) are missing.

Insert a missing voter ID manually.

You should print:

Number of duplicate votes found

Final cleaned voter list

List of missing voter IDs

✅ Question 5: Train Ticket Reservation System
You're maintaining a reservation list. Bookings and cancellations happen continuously. Each ticket has a passenger name and seat number.

Your task:

Use two lists: one for passenger names, another for seat numbers.

In a loop, cancel reservations (remove name and seat number) based on a list of canceled names.

Insert a new passenger at a specific seat number.

Count how many window seats (e.g., seat numbers divisible by 3) are booked.

Reverse the lists to simulate latest-to-oldest reservations.

You should print:

Updated list of passengers

Count of window seat bookings
